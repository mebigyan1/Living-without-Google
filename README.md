# Living-without-Google

One of the hardest thing to do when you have been using Google for the past several years is not to completely remove Google from your life. Whatever the reason, you have decided to live without Google here are some ways to do that. The only thing that can solve your problem is to replace Google products with other open source software or better alteratives. Offcourse its going to be tough when everything was linked without you having to do much things. But its worth it. If you are trying to find reason why to live without Google it's not for you.

Here are the technologies that can replace Google products:
## 1. Google Search -> DuckDuckGo
DuckDuckGo is one of the secure search engine you can use to be away from trackings and search privately. This is also easy to do. You just need to change the search engine from your browser from Google to DuckDuckGo.

## 2. Gmail, Contacts, Calendar -> FastMail
FastMail is an independent service that offers calendar and contact support across all of your devices.

## 3. Youtube -> Vimeo
If you are a content creator and use youtube, there is no way around this as Youtube is the second largest search engine. You can use Vimeo, but is not that popular compared to Youtube.

## 4. Google Maps -> OpenStreetMap
Check out OpenStreetMap to replace Google Maps. It may not have the same ease of use as Google Maps.

## 5. Google Drive -> Resilio Sync
Another service I use is called Resilio Sync which provides peer to peer file synchronization. This will be used for backup and file sharing. Also your files are never stored on a cloud server.

## 6. Android -> iOS
OS is by far the most popular alternative to Android. iOS offers encryption and encrypted messages by default.

## 7. Chrome -> Firefox
A cross compatible browser is Firefox which has an inbuilt tracker blocker. It is also open source so you have the option to view the source code for yourself and see if anything has been changed.

## 8. Blogger -> Wordpress
Wordpress is a great alternative to Googleâ€™s Blogger. Wordpress also powers an estimated 33% of the websites that are online. It has no third party trackers by default.

## 9. Google Hangouts/ Google Meet -> Zoom
Zoom is a great alternative which requires software to be installed onto your device.

## 10. Android Messages -> Signal
Signal offers free end to end encryption which makes your messages and calls private. It is highly recommended by Edward Snowden.

## 11. Google Groups -> Discourse
Discourse prides itself on being an open source platform dedicated to discussion. It offers both public and private conversations.
